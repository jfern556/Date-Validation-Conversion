# Date-Validation-Conversion

INPUT: Accepts one input through the Command Line. Reads a file called   
"dates.dat" and gets line by line to validate the lines in the file,   
making sure they are in the correct format mm/dd/yyyy and making sure the   
relation of month day and year are correct. Once dates are validated, 
they  get printed according to the initial number input. If the input is 1 
then one  line gets printed, if its 0 then all valid dates get printed, if its 
2 two   valid dates get printed and so on.
